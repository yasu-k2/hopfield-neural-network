# hopfield-neural-network
An implementation of hopfield neural network.

Hopfield neural network is one of the mathematical models that enables associative memory.
The dataset used is a collection of images consisting of Japanese letters. . In order to assess its performance, the degree of similarity(ZNCC) between the memorized pattern and the recalled pattern can be calculated amongst different noise rates given to the pattern.
